# blogDiaries
  This is a MERN Stack project.
  I am using https://github.com/mohammad-taheri1/Book-Store-MERN-Stack project as base code.
  The project will be a collection of stories that anybody could post/update/delete.
  These stories are like a short blog that include their experience of a particular place in the world.
  Users can add images that are managed using Cloudinary in the backend.
